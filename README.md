EXTENCORD is a **modular, extensible Discord bot platform**, designed to be easily expanded through standalone or integrated add-ons. The goal of the project is to provide a efficient, clean, scalable foundation for Discord bots, enabling communities and developers to modify, add or remove features without modifying the core application.

This platform is ideal for basic users such as guilds or servers owners, but also for developers who want long-term maintainability, ease of adding new functions, and in the future plug-and-play feature system.
